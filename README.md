# Blinkit Sales & Outlet Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Blinkit, India’s leading last-minute grocery delivery app, operates across multiple outlet types, locations, and product categories. Despite achieving impressive total sales of $1.20 million and maintaining an average rating of 3.9, the company faces challenges in understanding the granular performance of its diverse offerings.

With operations spread across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 cities, as well as a variety of outlet sizes and product types (e.g., fruits, snacks, dairy, frozen items), it becomes critical to analyze how these different factors influence revenue, item visibility, and customer satisfaction.

###Objectives:
Evaluate Outlet Performance: Analyze sales, number of items, and ratings across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations to identify high- and low-performing regions.

Understand Product Contribution: Determine which item types and fat content categories contribute most to overall sales and customer preferences.

Analyze Historical Trends: Study sales trends over time in relation to outlet establishment years to understand growth patterns and seasonal impacts.

Assess Outlet Type and Size Impact: Examine how outlet types (e.g., supermarket types, grocery stores) and outlet sizes (small, medium, high) affect total sales, average sales, and visibility.

Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Investigate the correlation between product mix, outlet characteristics, and average ratings to identify improvement areas.

###Tools Used
Power BI for interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.

Excel / SQL for data preparation and cleaning.

Advanced analytics and DAX formulas within Power BI for measures and dynamic filtering.

###Key Insights (as observed from dashboards)
Tier-wise Sales Contribution: Tier 3 outlets lead with $472.1K in sales, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1, indicating strong demand in smaller cities.

Item Type Performance: Fruits and snack foods are top sellers across all tiers, suggesting high consumer preference for fresh and ready-to-eat items.

Fat Content Preference: Low fat items dominate sales, hinting at a stronger focus on low-fat options.

Outlet Size Distribution: Medium-sized outlets contribute the highest share of sales, highlighting an optimal balance between product variety and operational efficiency.

Outlet Type Analysis: Supermarket Type 1 drives the highest total sales ($787.5K), but customer ratings remain consistently around 3.9 to 4, pointing to potential opportunities for service improvement.

Sales Trend Insights: Sales peaks are observed around 2018, indicating successful expansion phases or strategic campaigns.

Conclusion
This project aims to empower Blinkit’s leadership team with a comprehensive understanding of business performance at granular levels. The insights derived will help optimize outlet operations, tailor product offerings, improve customer experience, and guide future expansion and marketing strategies
